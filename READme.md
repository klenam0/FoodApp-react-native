## FOOD APP

### Welcome to the Foodie Express app, a React Native project designed to streamline your food delivery experience. This app allows users to explore a curated selection of restaurants and their offerings based on food categories and preferences. With features for browsing menus, viewing dish details, calculating order costs including delivery fees, and tracking real-time delivery progress, Foodie Express aims to make ordering food both convenient and enjoyable. Dive into the repository to see how weâ€™ve implemented these features and contribute to the ongoing development!
